// CLOSURES

let sayHello2 = { (name: String) -> String in
    return "Hi, \(name)!"

// Above, closures were assigned to variables/constants. Here, a closure is treated as an argument for a function.
// The filter function is a built-in function for arrays that only takes in 1 parameter. That parameter must be a closure.
// Additionally, the closure that you write must return a boolean.
// You don't need to know the underlying implementation of the filter function.
// Essentially, it iterates through each element in the array.
// The closure is executed for each element, with the element passed as the closure's parameter.
// If the closure returns true, the element is added to the new array.
// After the process repeats for all elements, it returns the new array.
// In the example, after the filter function, it will be "let onlyT = ["Tiffany", "Tasha"]". And "print(onlyT)" will print ["Tiffany", "Tasha"].

// STRUCTS
// Structs are a way to group related 'stored properties' (variables/constants) and functions into a single entity.
// A memberwise initializer is the name of the default initializer if you don't define one. Initializers help you set up all stored properties.
// When you create an instance/object of a struct like "Album(title: "Red", artist: "Taylor Swift")", it instantly calls the initializer.
// Whether you have a custom initializer or the default one, every stored property must be assigned a value when you create an object of a struct.
struct Album {

// COMPUTED PROPERTIES
// Stored properties are fields that store values which a struct uses.
// Computed properties are properties that don't store values, but compute them based on the stored properties.
// They have a get block which returns a value based on stored properties and an optional set block to modify stored properties.
// Called with 'object.computedProperty' for the getter.
// Called with 'object.computedProperty = ...' for the setter.
// The dot notation is similar to retrieving a stored property, just now, you are retrieving a computed property, which is based on the stored properties.
// The set block uses the reserved keyword "newValue" which is the right side of 'object.computedProperty = ...'.
// Think of "area" as the computed property that returns a Double. Don't think of it as a variable that's of type Double, even though that's what it looks like.
// It uses "var" (never "let") to show that the computed value (the return value) can change depending on the stored properties.
// The syntax is like this to be similar to stored properties. It is to emphasize that computed properties just return a computation based on stored properties or change the values of stored properties.

// EXTENSIONS
// Normally, 'var word = "hello"' is shorthand for 'var word = String("hello").
// "String", "Int", "Double", etc, are all built-in structs in Swift that have their own methods.
// For example, 'word.count()', is in the form of 'object.method' and calls the 'count' method inside 'String'.
// So, extensions allow you to add additional functionality (methods, computed properties, etc) to built-in structs, classes, etc, without modifying their original functionality.
extension String {
    func trimmed() -> String {
        self.trimmingCharacters(in: .whitespacesAndNewlines)    //returns a new string with leading and trailing whitespace, and newline characters removed.
    }
    // In this case, "mutating" is used because trim() updates the value of the quote1 string object it is called on, even though there aren't any stored properties in a struct.
    mutating func trim() {
        self = self.trimmed()   //modifies the original string by trimming whitespace and newline characters.
    }
    // 'lines' is a computed property that returns a string array, each element being a line in the original string.
    var lines: [String] {
        self.components(separatedBy: .newlines)     //this is implicitly inside a get block and is returned.
    }
}

// PROTOCOL EXTENSIONS
// Remember that normally, extension are for built-in structs like 'String' where you can add extra methods.
// However, you can also add extensions for protocols like 'Collection', which are conformed to by many built-in structs like 'Array' and 'Dictionary'.
// This means a struct like 'Array' requires implementations of all of Collection's abstract methods and properties.
// However, when you add an extension to a protocol like 'Collection', you aren't saying that all of the structs that conform to the protocol must have their own implementation of "isNotEmpty".
// You are just saying that every struct will now have an added 'isNotEmpty' computed property in their struct that already has a body.
extension Collection {
    // 'isNotEmpty' is a computed property with one 'get' statement.
    // 'isEmpty' is a computed property part of Collection that was implemented by the Array struct.
    var isNotEmpty: Bool {
        isEmpty == false    //implicit 'get' block and no 'set' block. there is also an implicit "self.isEmpty == false" where self refers to "guests". note that the keyword 'self' has multiple uses and this is one of them.
    }
}
let guests = ["Mario", "Luigi", "Peach"]
if guests.isNotEmpty {      //'object.computedProperty' which accesses the get block and returns it.
    print("Guest count: \(guests.count)")
}

// OPTIONALS
// An optional is either a value or nil (no value).
// Accessing a value inside an optional is called unwrapping.
var lastName: String?   //example declaration. 'lastName' can be a String or nil.

let opposites = [
    "Mario": "Wario",
    "Luigi": "Waluigi"
]
let peachOpposite = opposites["Peach"]  //peachOpposite is an optional string

// "!" forcefully unwraps an optional. "if let" and "guard let" is more recommended.
var name2: String? = "Jun"
if name2 != nil {
    print(name2!) // force unwrap
}

// The pattern "if let" safely unwraps optionals.
// Check if opposites["Mario"] is nil or contains a value; if it contains a value, marioOpposite is assigned it and execute the body, else skip the body.
if let marioOpposite = opposites["Mario"] {
    print("Mario's opposite is \(marioOpposite)")
}

// "if let" runs the block if the optional has a value.
// "guard let" does the opposite and runs the block if the optional does NOT have a value (it is nil).
// It is always used with "else". "guard let" is usually used in functions bc it checks if an optional is nil, and if it is, it exits out of the loop, and doesn't allow the rest of the code to run.
// Meanwhile, with "if let", if the optional is nil, the code inside the block is skipped, but the rest of the code in the function is still run.
func printSquare(number: Int?) {
    guard let num = number else {
        print("missing input")
        return
    }
    print("\(num) x \(num) is \(num * num)")
}
print(printSquare(number: nil))

// NIL COALESCING
// Use a "??" to provide a default value if the optional is nil.
//'tvShows.randomElement()' returns an optional String, which is one of the elements, or nil if the array is empty.
// if 'randomElement()' return nil, 'favorite' is assigned "None".
let tvShows = ["Archer", "Babylon 5", "Ted Lasso"]
let favorite = tvShows.randomElement() ?? "None"
// 'Int(input) attempts to convert 'input' to an 'Int'.
// 'Int(input)' is an optional Int (it can be an Int or a nil). Since 'input' is "", the conversion fails, and when 'Int(input)' fails, it returns nil.
let input = ""
let num = Int(input) ?? 0
print(num)  //Output: 0

// OPTIONAL CHAINING
// The process of calling methods on an optional that might currently be nil.
// If the optional contains a value, then the method succeeds. if the optional is nil, the method call also returns nil.
// If any part of a chain is nil, the entire assignment doesn't happen.
// If 'names.randomElement()' returns nil, then it doesn't even read the rest (doesn't read '.uppercased()') and the entire right side is nil. so 'chosen' = nil.
// If 'chosen' = nil, then it would return "No one" in the next line.
let names = ["Arya", "Bran", "Robb", "Sansa"]
let chosen = names.randomElement()?.uppercased()    //you also use "?" after a method call to specify that it returns something that's either a value or nil.
print("Next in line: \(chosen ?? "No one")")

// OPTIONAL TRY?
// Another way to handle errors thrown by functions instead of using a do-catch block.
// If 'getUser(id: 23)' results in an error, the 'try?' converts it to a nil.
// Since 'user = nil', the 'if' block won't run and the 'else' block will run.
// If the function does not throw an error, then 'user' is just assigned the result of the function's return statement, and the 'if' block does run.
enum UserError: Error {
    case badID, networkFailed
}
func getUser(id: Int) throws -> String {
    throw UserError.networkFailed

}
